Neural Style Transfer Application
Welcome to our Neural Style Transfer application! This tool allows you to transform images by applying the artistic style of one image to the content of another. Dive into the fascinating world of generating art with deep learning.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
To start the application, navigate to the cloned directory and run python main.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your content and style images.
About Neural Style Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) leverages deep learning to blend two images—the "content" image and the "style" reference—creating a composite image that mirrors the content of the former in the style of the latter. This technique uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate and recombine the content and style of images, producing results that captivate both the art and technology worlds. It's a powerful tool for creative expression, allowing for endless possibilities in design, content generation, and even in fields like gaming and virtual reality.
